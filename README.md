This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

# Tools Used
1. Typescript + React
2. CSS

## How to Install and Run
1. Clone the repository using `git clone [repo_url]`
2. In the project folder, run `yarn` or `npm install` if you do not have yarn installed
3. Use the `yarn start` script mentioned below to run it in a browser.
4. In the address bar of the browser, type in the id of the tournament e.g. 177071, 180251 etc. This will display the results of said tournament
5. CORS will most likely be an issue to install the browser extension [Moesif Origin & CORS Changer](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/moesif-orign-cors-changer/digfbfaphojjndkpccljibejjbppifbc). Turn it on and the app will work just fine
